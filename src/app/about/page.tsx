              Photo Privacy Analyzer is a free, open-source tool designed to help users understand what private information might be leaked through their photos.
              In this digital age, photos contain more than just images â€” they also include various metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc.),
              which may reveal your location, device information, and other sensitive details.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
              Our main goal is to raise awareness about digital privacy and provide a simple way to detect and understand metadata in photos.
              All analysis is performed locally in your browser, without uploading your photos to any server, ensuring your privacy is protected.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>
              Photo Privacy Analyzer is built with modern web technologies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Next.js - React framework</li>
              <li>TailwindCSS - Styling and UI design</li>
              <li>Exifr - Client-side EXIF data parsing</li>
              <li>React Dropzone - File upload functionality</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Privacy Commitment</h2>
            <p>
              We take your privacy very seriously. That's why Photo Privacy Analyzer is a completely client-side application:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your photos never leave your device</li>
              <li>All analysis is performed in your browser</li>
              <li>No trackers or analytics tools are used</li>
              <li>No user data is stored</li>
            </ul>
